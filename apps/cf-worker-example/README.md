> Note: This will always use the local monorepo version, if you plan only using the source make sure to either use the actual version used in the cloned monorepo or use the **npm** version that is compatible with cloned source code

# Interaction files

> Interaction files **cannot** be auto loaded as you would normally do in a server environment since the all files must be bundled to single file with base code to be deployed
