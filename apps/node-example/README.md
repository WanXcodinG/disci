# Nodejs example with hono

Using DisciJS with a [nodejs server](https://nodejs.org)
**This can be used as a complete discord bot template for disciJS with cloudflare workers**

Uses [hono](https://hono.dev/) for the base server.


## Features

* Automatic Loading for SlashCommands, AutoComplete, ContextMenu etc...
* Powered by hono (Hono can be used with any other runtime with minimal changes to the base code)
* Uses discord-verify for request verification - uses faster webcrypto instead of tweetnacl
