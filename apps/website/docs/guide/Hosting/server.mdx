### Creating a project

To start you can either use our cli tool `create-disci` or generate one on your own using nodejs. This guide will explore on how to create a new bot using our cli tool `create-disci`

First open a commands prompt and cd into the directory you want to create the project in and then run following command

<Tabs groupId="cliCommands">
  <TabItem value="npm" label="npm" default>

  ```bash
  npm create disci node-ts
  ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="pnpm" label="pnpm">

  ```bash
  pnpm create disci node-ts
  ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="yarn" label="yarn">

  ```bash
  yarn create disci node-ts
  ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>


This should quickly scaffold a new application for you



## Manual setup

We suggest you to read the manual setup guide even with "quick setup" to get an idea on how the 
project works.

Note: Each file structure may differ depending on your [hosting provider](#platforms-available) 
how ever the base file structure used in any DisciJS project should be (suggested) as follows


```js
src/        // your source code for the bot
  index.ts // main file
```
