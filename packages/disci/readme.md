# ðŸŽ¨ DisciJs

Easy to use library for creating discord applications via interaction webhooks.

# ðŸš€ Install

Use any of the following commands

```bash
npm install disci

# yarn

yarn add disci

# pnpm

pnpm add disci

```

# Overview

DisciJs contains the minimum code to create a discord application with the new (relatively) interaction webhook system. DisciJs does not itself include validation of received interactions, we expect the **user** to handle that before passing us the data.

You can use [discord-interactions-js](https://github.com/discord/discord-interactions-js) for validation of received requests
